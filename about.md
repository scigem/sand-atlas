The Sand Atlas is an effort to collate data describing the shape and morphology of a wide range of sand grains. This data can be viewed online and downloaded for free.

# Technical details
For all images, the original source data is a micro-CT scan of an assembly of particles. These particles are individually labelled by the researcher who has submitted the data to The Sand Atlas. At this stage, a quality check is performed. To generate particle information consistently, particle surface meshes and level sets are produced using [openVDB](https://www.openvdb.org/). The meshes are passed through [SHaPE](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465521000953) to produce the shape descriptors. The data is then uploaded to the website and made available for download.
